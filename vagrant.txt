Download & install Vagrant from vagrantup.com
Download & install virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

in the main orisi folder:

vagrant box add orisi http://oracles.li/orisi.box
^ this is ~1GB download, sorry about that
it seems our ISP has trouble handling the large files. we put up a mirror on Mega:
https://mega.co.nz/#!HQwmWSzb!QvJ3CB2k8Xv-hQVSQpDiWsREN9YxhVZ7Qt-O5Z3WzPg
you can download it using a browser and then do:
vagrant box add orisi path/to/orisi.box

We'll move the orisi.box to a better hosting provide asap.

vagrant init orisi
vagrant up

the above initiates a vagrant box containing bitcoind, bitmessage, and current oracle repo mapped onto /vagrant/

now ssh into the box:

vagrant ssh

after the first login, run:
./secrets.sh

this will generate API passwords for bitcoind & bitmessage.

then, run:
./runbitcoin
./runbitmessage
cd /vagrant/src/oracle/
python main.py

this should start the bitoin & bitmessage daemons, switch you into the main oracle folder, and run the oracle.
after the first oracle run a private bitcoin address will be generated, and you'll be asked to put it into your settings file
