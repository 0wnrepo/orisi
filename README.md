#Oracles Distributed - Orisi ALPHA

* [Read the White Paper](https://github.com/orisi/wiki/wiki/Orisi-White-Paper) - Introduction to Orisi

* [Installing with Vagrant](./vagrant.txt) - Instructions for setting up the oracle node with a Vagrant box 

---------------------

* [./src/oracle](./src/oracle) - oracle node source

* [./src/client](./src/client) - reference client _almost ready. We had slight issues with multisigs not propagating through to Blockchain, but those are all solved now._

---------------------

* Please keep in mind that both client and oracle are in very early alpha version and are very unstable. We encourage you to use them and test them. Please post any issue with [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/orisi/orisi/issues). If you have any fixes do not hesitate to post [Pull Requests](https://github.com/orisi/orisi/pulls)
